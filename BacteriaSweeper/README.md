Bacteria Sweeper

The player controls a nano space ship (the ball symbol) that was injected into a human body.
The goal is to kill all bacteria (the X symbols) that appear on the screen before things get out of hand and there is too much bacteria on the screen.
Every kill earns 10 points. Once the last bacterium is removed from the screen the player moves on to the next level.

Killing bacteria is easy. Just use the joystick in port 2 to control the ship towards the bacteria and it will disappear.

Game parameters:
There is a number of bacteria that wil spawn at the beginning of each level.
The game is lost if there is a certain number of bacteria items on screen or if the time runs out.
