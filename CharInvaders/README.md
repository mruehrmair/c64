# Char Invaders

Char Invaders is a Space Invaders clone. It's a one page shooter where there is a player sprite a the bottom of the screen, that is able to move horizontally and has some destroyable cover above.
The difference to the original Space Invaders is the randomness of the appearing opponents. Unlike in the original game, there are no fixed formations of the alien ships.
To make things easy the alien ships and the player's covers are PETSCII characters.
